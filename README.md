-The project

The project was to create a tool which randomly selects a 5-a-side football teams from a list of 10 names.

-My project and how it works

1/Add players: You add the names of up to ten players
2/Rotate Team: You can then randomnly shuffle the players around which while doing so will pick an attribute out of 25 for both attack and defence. You can adjust these totals simply by rotating the squad.
3/Kick off: A score is then generated based on the attack / defend attributes.

-Wireframes

These can be found in the images folder updated to github

-Technologies

I worked with html, css, sass and javascript for this project.

-Testing

Tested on chrome, IE & microsoft edge, firefox

Have issues on microsoft edge when clicking on the rotate team button. This splits and adjusts the picture. Unsure as to why.
No problems with any of the other browers
