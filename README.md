-The project

The project was to create a tool which randomly selects a 5-a-side football teams from a list of 10 names.

-My project and how it works

1--Add players: Add the names of up to ten players
2--Rotate Team: You can then randomnly shuffle the players around which while doing so will pick an attribute out of 25 for both attack and defence. You can adjust these totals simply by rotating the squad.
3--Kick off: A score is then generated

-Wireframes

These can be found in the images folder updated to github

-Technologies

I worked with html, css, sass and javascript for this project.

-Testing

Tested on chrome, firefox, IE & microsoft edge

Have issues on microsoft edge when clicking on the rotate team button. This splits and adjusts the picture. Unsure as to why.
No problems with any of the other browsers

-Git

I decided to work on the master branch since I was the only one involved in this porject. Otherwise I would have switched to using branches for any updates

-Improvements. There are still improvments I am looking to finish. These are as follows:

--No option to remove a name
--No optionto add a team name
--Adding more then ten players pushes the defence / attack to the right
--The rotate Team button is not deactivated prior to adding player names
--The scores are not predicated based on the attack / defense totals
--No message pop up once a score is determined confirming a team winner
--No other means to start again other then refreshing the page
